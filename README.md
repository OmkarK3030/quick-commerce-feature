# 🤝 Community Group Ordering – Quick Commerce Feature

A product feature PRD designed to enhance the efficiency and profitability of quick commerce platforms by enabling community-based group ordering. This solution aims to improve Average Order Value (AOV), reduce delivery costs, and increase user engagement through collaborative purchasing.

Quick commerce platforms often face the challenge of delivering small, frequent orders while maintaining profitability and delivery speed. This PRD introduces **Community Group Ordering**, where users in shared spaces (e.g., apartments, offices, co-living spaces) can create and join group carts to split delivery fees and consolidate logistics.
